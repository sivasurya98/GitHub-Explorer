## Download Project After
First you will install npm pacakages. Open a new terminal.

```bash
# npm install
npm install

 ```
## Step 1: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal.

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using

npx react-native start

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
